# phaser-game-endless-runner
This project is an isometric endless runner developed in Phaser. The player navigates through a procedurally generated isometric world, avoiding obstacles and surviving as long as possible while the game progressively increases in difficulty.

#Purpose of this repository

This repository was created as a portfolio project to showcase skills in:

Abstraction and logical problem solving.

Using simple languages like JavaScript to build functional solutions.

Team collaboration in a small group of 2 people.

Implementation of game logic and algorithmic thinking.

Basic good practices in code organization.

The main goal is to demonstrate the learning process, the ability to structure solutions, and the application of core programming concepts in practical projects.
